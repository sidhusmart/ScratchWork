THINGS I LEARN EVERY DAY (T.I.L.E.D.)

1. Dense versus Sparse representations of Sparse vectors
    - One Hot Encoding in Spark returns a Dense vector of ones
    - If your model is not built on Spark MLLIB you will need to conver this to Pandas or create a local version through some workarounds
    - When you convert it using toPandas, that too continues the Dense representation
    - Use the in-built methods to convert this to a sparse representations of 1s and 0s
    - Or you could change the model to diffrentiate how this reads your features and allow it to read Dense vectors
    
2. Genetic Algorithms
    - One of the optimization algorithms to solve the ML optimization problem more quickly
    - Tries to mimic the survival of the fittest real life scenario in the case of models
    - Several models are trained to create an initial population
    - Only the best n models are chosen to go to the next round - these are called as parents
    - Parents are interbred and mutated to create several other slightly different models
    - Then again selection of the best model happens across all these models
    - And so on till a certain set limit is reached (if set) or through some other convergence criteria
